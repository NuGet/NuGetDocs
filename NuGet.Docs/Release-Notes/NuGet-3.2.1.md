[NuGet 3.2 Release Notes](nuget-3.2)

NuGet 3.2.1 for the command-line was released October 12, 2015 with a handful of optimizations and fixes for the 3.2 release and is available from [dist.nuget.org](http://dist.nuget.org/index.html).

## Improvements

* NuGet now uses the configuration file with the original casing of `NuGet.Config`.  This is important on case-sensitive operating systems [1427](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1427)
* NuGet restore will now ignore dnx projects (*.xproj) that should be processed with `dnu` [1227](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1227)
* Optimized network utilization when working with index.json and package registration data [1426](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1426)
* Improved resource download handling to be more robust with v2 services [1448](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1448)

## Fixes

* NuGet update correctly updates csproj/vcxproj references [1483](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1483)
* Now preventing a local .nuget folder from being created when a SpecialFolders.UserProfile cannot be located [1531](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1531)
* Improved handling of packages in local cache that are corrupted during download [1405](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1405) [1157](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1157)
