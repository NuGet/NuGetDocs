# NuGet 2.8.5 Release Notes

[NuGet 2.8.3 Release Notes](nuget-2.8.3) | [NuGet 3.0 Preview Release Notes](nuget-3.0-preview)

NuGet 2.8.5 was released March 30, 2015. It is a minor update to our 2.8.3 VSIX with some targeted fixes. 

In this release, the support for NuGet Package Manager dialog was added for [DNX Target Framework Monikers](https://github.com/aspnet/dnx).  These new framework monikers that are supported include:

* **core50** - A 'base' target framework moniker (TFM) that is compatible with the Core CLR.
* **dnx452** - A TFM specific to DNX-based apps using the full 4.5.2 version of the framework
* **dnx46** - A TFM specific to DNX-based apps using the full 4.6 version of the framework
* **dnxcore50** - A TFM specific to DNX-based apps using the Core 5.0 version of the framework

One bug was fixed that prevented packages from installing into FSharp projects properly:
