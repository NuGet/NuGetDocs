[NuGet 3.3 Release Notes](nuget-3.3) 

NuGet 3.4-RC was released March 3, 2016 alongside the Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 RC and was built with a few tenets in minds:

*  Cross-Platform support
*  Performance improvements
*  Minor UI improvements

## New Features

* NuGet clients now support gzip content-encoding from repositories
* Support for PDBs from packages in xproj projects
* Support for iOS and Android build actions in the contentFiles element
* Support for the netstandard and netstandardapp framework monikers

## New User Interface Features

* Significant performance improvements especially on the Installed, Updates, and Consolidate tabs
* Installed and Updates tabs are now sorted alphabetically
* Added a Refresh button that allows a search to be refreshed
* 'All' package sources search has been reintroduced with improved support for slower package repositories

## Updates and Improvements


* Packages referenced in project.json that have a floating version will not update on every build. Instead, they will update only when forced to restore, clean, rebuild, or modify project.json.
* NuGet.org repository sources are no longer forced into a project configuration when you use the NuGet configuration UI.
* NuGet no longer restores packages in shared projects nor writes a lock file.
* We've improved network failure and retry handling for unreachable or slow-to-respond servers.
* Keyboard and mouse behaviors are improved in the Visual Studio Package Manager UI.
* We now support the latest project.json schema in DNX.
