# NuGet 3.2 Release Notes

[NuGet 3.2 Release Notes](nuget-3.2)

NuGet 3.2 was released September 16, 2015 as a collection of improvements and fixes for the 3.1.1 release and is available from both [dist.nuget.org](http://dist.nuget.org/index.html) and the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d345edc-2e2d-4a9c-b73b-d53956dc458d?SRC=Home). 

## New Features

* Projects that live in the same folder can now have different project.json files in that folder specific to each project.  For each project, name the project.json file {ProjectName}.project.json and NuGet will give preference to that configuration for each project appropriately.  This supports a new feature  [1102](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1102) 
* NuGet.config now supports a globalPackagesFolder setting as a relative path - [1062](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1062)

## Command-line updates

There were a number of authenticated feed issues that were addressed in this release to improve interactions with the client.

* Install / restore interactions only submit credentials for the initial request to the authenticated feed - [1300](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1300), [456](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/456)
* Push command does not resolve credentials from configuration - [1248](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1248)
* User agent and headers are now submitted to NuGet repositories to help with statistics tracking - [929](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/929)

We made a number of improvements to better handle network failures while attempting to work with a remote NuGet repository:

* Improved error messages when unable to connect to remote feeds - [1238](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1238)
* Corrected NuGet restore command to properly return a 1 when an error condition occurs - [1186](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1186)
* Now retrying network connections every 200ms for a maximum of 5 attempts in the case of HTTP 5xx failures - [1120](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1120) 
* Improved handling of server redirect responses during a push command - [1051](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1051)
* `nuget install -source` now supports either URL or repository name from nuget.config as an argument - [1046](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1046)
* Missing packages that were not located on a repository during a restore are now reported as errors instead of warnings [1038](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1038)
* Corrected multipartwebrequest handling of \r\n for Unix/Linux scenarios - [776](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/776)

There are a number of fixes to issues with various commands:

* Push command no longer does a GET before a PUT against a package source - [1237](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1237)
* List command no longer repeats version numbers - [1185](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1185)
* Pack with the -build argument now properly supports C# 6.0 - [1107](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1107)
* Corrected issues attempting to pack an F# project built with Visual Studio 2015 - [1048](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1048)
* Restore now no-ops when packages already exist - [1040](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1040)
* Improved error messages when packages.config file is malformed - [1034](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1034)
* Corrected restore command with -SolutionDirectory switch to work with relative paths - [992](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/992)
* Improved Updated command to support solution-wide update - [924](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/924)

A complete list of issues addressed in this release can be found in the NuGet GitHub [Command-Line milestone](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.2.0-commandline+is%3Aclosed+-label%3AClosedAs%3ADuplicate).

## Visual Studio extension updates

### New Features in Visual Studio

* A new context menu item was added to the Solution Explorer on the solution node that allows packages to be restored without building the solution ([1274](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1274)).

### Updates and Fixes in Visual Studio

The fixes for authenticated feeds were rolled up and addressed in the extension as well.  The following authentication items were also addressed in the extension:

* Now correctly treating NuGet v3 authenticated feeds properly, instead of as v2 authenticated feeds - [1216](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1216)
* Corrected request for authentication credentials in projects using project.json and communicating with v2 feeds - [1082](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1082)
