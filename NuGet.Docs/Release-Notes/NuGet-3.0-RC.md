# NuGet 3.0 RC Release Notes

[NuGet 3.0 Beta Release Notes](nuget-3.0-beta)

NuGet 3.0 RC was released on April 29, 2015 with the Visual Studio 2015 RC release. This release has a number of important bug fixes, performance improvements and updates to support the new frameworks.  It is only available for Visual Studio 2015.

### Continued Focus on Performance 

Stability and performance of NuGet queries continue to be a hot topic that we are focusing on.  With this release, you should start to see very quick search operations in the NuGet UI and website.  We're monitoring the service and how you use the service so that we can continue to tune these operations.

## Significant Issues Resolved

In order to stabilize the NuGet clients, we resolved many issues as part of this release.  Here is just a brief list of some of the more important issues resolved:  

* As part of the rename of the K framework for ASP.NET 5, framework monikers have been updated to handle dnx and dnxcore [link](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/215)
