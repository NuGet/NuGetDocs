## New Command-line Features

In this version we introduced the init and add commands to initialize [folder-based repositories](http://docs.nuget.org/Consume/Command-Line-Reference#folder-repository-commands).  Repositories that are constructed and maintained with this folder structure will [deliver significant performance benefits](http://blog.nuget.org/20150922/Accelerate-Package-Source.html) as outlined on our blog. 

## ContentFiles

Content is now supported in project.json managed projects through the new `contentFiles` folder and nuspec `contentFiles` element notation.  This content can be more directly specified by the package author for interactions with project systems.  More information about how to configure contentFiles in a NuSpec document can be found in the [NuSpec Reference](http://docs.nuget.org/Create/Nuspec-Reference#contentfiles-with-visual-studio-2015-update-1-and-later).

## NuGet Locals Cache Management 

The NuGet command-line has been updated to include information about how to manage the local caches on a workstation.  More information about the locals command is available in the [NuGet command-line reference](http://docs.nuget.org/Consume/Command-Line-Reference#locals-command).
