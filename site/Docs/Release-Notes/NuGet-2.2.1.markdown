## Visual Studio Templates Support Multiple Preinstalled Package Repositories
If you produce Visual Studio templates, you can use NuGet to [preinstall packages](../Reference/Packages-in-Visual-Studio-Templates) as part of the template.  Until now, this feature had a limitation that all of the packages needed to come from the same source.  With NuGet 2.2.1 though, you can have packages installed from multiple repositories (within the template, a VSIX, or a folder on disk defined in the registry).

The main scenario for this feature is custom ASP.NET project templates.  The built-in ASP.NET templates use preinstalled packages, pulling packages from local disk.  You can now create a custom ASP.NET project template that uses the existing packages installed by ASP.NET but add extra NuGet packages into your template.

## Bug Fixes
NuGet 2.2.1 includes a few targeted bug fixes. For a list of work items fixed in NuGet 2.2.1, please view the [NuGet Issue Tracker for this release](http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&status=Closed&type=All&priority=All&release=NuGet%202.2.1&assignedTo=All&component=All&sortField=LastUpdatedDate&sortDirection=Descending&page=0).


## Known Issues

If you are extending ASP.NET project templates, all preinstalled package repositories must use the same value for the `isPreunzipped` attribute.
