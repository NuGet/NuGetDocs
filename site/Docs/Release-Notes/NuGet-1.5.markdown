# NuGet 1.5 Release Notes

## Features

### Project Templates with Preinstalled NuGet Packages
When creating a new ASP.NET MVC 3 project template, the jQuery script libraries included 
in the project are actually placed there by installing NuGet packages. 

The ASP.NET MVC 3 project template includes a set of NuGet packages that get installed 
when the project template is invoked. This ability to include NuGet packages with a 
project template is now a feature of NuGet that _any_ project template can now take 
advantage of.

For more details about this feature, read this [blog post by the developer of the feature](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/marcinon/archive/2011/07/08/project-templates-and-preinstalled-nuget-packages.aspx).

### Explicit Assembly References
Added a new `<references />` element used to explicitly specify which assemblies within the 
the package should be referenced.

For example, if you add the following:

    <references>
      <reference file="xunit.dll" />
      <reference file="xunit.extensions.dll" />
    </references>

Then only the _xunit.dll_ and _xunit.extensions.dll_ will be referenced from the appropriate 
[framework/profile subdirectory](../creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#Grouping_Assemblies_by_Framework_Version) 
of the `lib` folder even if there are other assemblies in the folder.

If this element is omitted, then the usual behavior applies, which is to reference every assembly 
in the lib folder.

__What is this feature used for?__

This feature supports design-time only assemblies. For example, when using Code Contracts, the 
contract assemblies need to be next to the runtime assemblies that they augment so that Visual 
Studio can find them, but the contract assemblies should not actually be referenced by the project 
and should not be copied into the bin folder.

Likewise, the feature can be used to for unit test frameworks such as XUnit which need its tools 
assemblies to be located next to the runtime assemblies, but excluded from project references.

### Added ability to exclude files in the NuSpec
The `<file>` element within a NuSpec file can be used to include a specific file or a set of files 
using a wildcard. When using a wildcard, there's no way to exclude a specific subset of the included 
files. For example, suppose you want all text files within a directory except a specific one.

    <files>
        <file src="*.txt" target="content\docs" exclude="admin.txt" />
    </files>

Use semicolons to specify multiple files.

    <files>
        <file src="*.txt" target="content\docs" exclude="admin.txt;log.txt" />
    </files>

Or use a wild card to exclude a set of files such as all backup files

    <files>
        <file src="tools\*.*" target="tools" exclude="*.bak" />
    </files>

### Removing packages using the dialog prompts to remove dependencies
When uninstalling a package with dependencies, NuGet prompts, allowing the removal of a package's 
dependencies along with the package.

### `Get-Package` command improvement
The `Get-Package` command now supports a `-ProjectName` parameter. So the command

    Get-Package –ProjectName A

will list all packages installed in project A. 

### Support for Proxies that require authentication
When using NuGet behind a proxy that requires authentication, NuGet will now prompt for 
proxy credentials. Entering credentials allows NuGet to connect to the remote repository.

### Support for Repositories that require authentication
NuGet now supports connecting to [private repositories](../creating-packages/hosting-your-own-nuget-feeds) 
that require basic or NTLM authentication.

Support for Digest authentication will be added in a future release.

### Performance improvements to the NuGet.org repository
We've made several performance improvements to the NuGet.org gallery to make package listing 
and searching faster.

### Solution dialog project filtering
In the Solution-level dialog, when prompting for what projects to install, we only show 
projects that are compatible with the selected package.

### Package Release Notes
NuGet packages now include support for release notes. The release notes only show up 
when viewing _Updates_ for a package, so it doesn't make sense to add them to your 
first release.

To add release notes to a package, use the new `<releaseNotes />` metadata element in your 
NuSpec file.

### NuSpec `<files />` improvement
The .nuspec file now allows empty &lt;files /&gt; element, which tells nuget.exe 
not to include any file in the package.

## Bug Fixes
NuGet 1.5 had a total of 107 work items fixed. 103 of those were marked as bugs.

For a full list of work items fixed in NuGet 1.5, please view the [NuGet Issue Tracker for this release](http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced?keyword=&status=All&type=All&priority=All&release=NuGet%201.5&assignedTo=All&component=All&sortField=Summary&sortDirection=Descending&page=0).

## Bug fixes worth noting:

* [Issue 1273](http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/1273): Made packages.config more version control 
friendly by sorting packages alphabetically and removing extra whitespace.
* [Issue 844](http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/844): Version numbers are now normalized so that 
`Install-Package 1.0` works on a package with the version `1.0.0`.
* [Issue 1060](http://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/1060): When creating a package using NuGet.exe, 
the `-Version` flag overrides the `<version />` element.
