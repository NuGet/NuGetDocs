# Using NuGet without committing packages to source control

The original NuGet workflow has been to commit the Packages folder into source control. The 
reasoning is that it matches what developers typically do when they don't have NuGet: they create a 
`Lib` or `ExternalDependencies` folder, dump binaries into there and commit them to source control 
to allow others to build.

While this has worked fine for some users, we have also heard from many that committing packages 
into source control is not what they want to do. When using a DVCS like Mercurial or Git, committing 
binaries can grow the repository size like crazy over time, making cloning more and more painful. In 
fact, this has been one of the top requests on NuGet our issue tracker.

The good news is that NuGet now offers a workflow which goes a long way to solving this problem, and is
really easy to set up. Here is the way to do it:

## Enabling Package Restore During Build

Beginning with NuGet 2.0, [restoring packages during build requires explicit consent from the
user](http://blog.nuget.org/20120518/package-restore-and-consent.html). This must be done on
each machine that builds the project.

In Visual Studio, enable "Allow NuGet to download missing packages during build". This setting lives
under **Options -> Package Manager -> General**.

To enable package restore for build servers without Visual Studio installed, you can also set the
environment variable `EnableNuGetPackageRestore` to "true".

## Project Setup
Let’s assume that you have a solution that is either already using NuGet, or planning to use it, and that
you want to set up the no-commit workflow.

Right click on the _Solution_ node in Solution Explorer and select _Enable NuGet Package Restore_.

**That's it!** You're all set.

## Details
So what exactly did that do? It added a solution folder named .nuget containing NuGet.exe and a NuGet.targets MsBuild file. More specifically, it downloaded and extracted two NuGet packages: NuGet.Bootstrapper for NuGet.exe and NuGet.Build for NuGet.targets. It also changed every project in the solution to import the NuGet.targets MsBuild task.

Finally, it added a NuGet.config file with the following XML:

	<configuration>
	  <solution>
	    <add key="disableSourceControlIntegration" value="true" />
	  </solution>
	</configuration>

The disableSourceControlIntegration setting instructs version control systems like TFS to not add the NuGet packages folder to the pending check-ins list.

With this in place, any time a project is compiled, the build task will look at each project's packages.config file and for each package listed, ensure that the corresponding package exists within the packages folder. For any missing package, the build task will download and unpack the package.

In this scenario, NuGet will grab the exact version when restoring a package. It will not perform any upgrades.

## Mono
On mono you can run `xbuild` on the project file or on your solution and it should successfully 
restore packages for any project that has package restore enabled.
